###Full Stack Web Development

My primary skill set includes Ruby, Rails, Javascript, JQuery and AJAX. More recently I'm enjoying AngularJS and MongoDB. I strongly believe in testing and tools such as Rspec, Capybara, Factory Girl and Cucumber.

###Marketing & Strategy

I have a strong background in data-driven marketing and product strategy. My expertise is in marketing automation and customer activation, which I've provided at startups like [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com/) and [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com/). I have extensive experience in designing and implementing bespoke analytics platforms for startups.
