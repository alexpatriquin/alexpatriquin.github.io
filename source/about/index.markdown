Hello, welcome to my professional site, SquareCraft.co. This is where I [blog](/) about programming, explain the [services](/services) that I offer and post my client and side [projects](/blog/categories/projects/).

In a nutshell, my business is to enable startups and high-potential projects to accelerate their growth and build strong customer relationships. I do this through my somewhat unique background, having both strong marketing and web development experience.

My current focus is primarily web development, though with my marketing experience I do offer a bonus to employers who are interested in that. I'm also very happy to work with an exclusively technical focus.

I have experience building web applications in Ruby on Rails. I strongly believe in Test-Driven Development and like to use Rspec and Capybara. With my marketing and product background, I also know how to design highly usable applications and to position them for rapid growth through data-driven strategy.

I am extremely passionate about building things and, in 2013, I made the transition from working closely with web developers to becoming one myself. I recently graduated from The Flatiron School, an immersive web development training program, and am actively seeking a role as a developer at a startup or tech-driven company that will enable me to continue to grow my technical skill set.
